            Hello! :)<br/>
            I'm Roger, a Mobile Software Engineer with over 5 years of solid experience, working with multi-million-dollar companies. 
            I have hands-on expertise in Swift, SwiftUI, Async/Await, Combine, architectural patterns such as MVC, MVVM, design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and CI/CD practices, including tools like SwiftLint and Fastlane.
            <br/><br/>
            Throughout my career, I have been consistently recognized for my strong organizational and problem-solving skills, having contributed for many financial-related mobile apps with massive user bases.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to my engineering skills, I am known for my kind and clear communication, fostering a supportive work environment.
            <br/><br/>
            Currently, I am focused on improving my approach to building modular, testable, and highly scalable applications for large-scale projects.
